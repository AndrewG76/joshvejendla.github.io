## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a software development platform that hosts project repositories and manages them using distributed version control (Git). 

Software developers and IT professionals use GitHub to collaborate on and build software projects.

## Key concepts in GitHub

1. Repository: 
2. Version Control:
3. Branch: 
4. Fork: copies a version of another person's software repository to your own GitHub account
5. Clone: copies a local version of a software repository to your computer

Use case for a fork: "I want to make a copy of this repository to propose changes"

Use case for a clone: "I want to download this software to my computer and use this myself"

7. Commit: 
8. Pull Request: proposes changes to another person's repository

## Walkthrough of GitHub Skills challenge

Create a branch from main ⇒ Commit a change ⇒ Open a pull request ⇒ Merge your pull request

## Collaboration in practice

Between two partners:

1. Partner 1: Forks a copy of Partner 2's repository
2. Partner 1: Commits a change to the repository
3. Partner 1: Opens a pull request to Partner 2's repository
4. Partner 2: Reviews Partner 1's pull request
5. Partner 2: If Partner 1's proposed changes are accepted, Partner 2 merges the pull request to their own repository
